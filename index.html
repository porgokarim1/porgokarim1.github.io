<div class="intro">
        <p>It all started with a blinking airplane light in the middle of the night.
        I told my mom it is a moving star and she replied "it is an airplay".</p>
        <p>At that time, I never saw a plane in person and had never been close to it.
         Can They see us? I asked my mom. " I DON'T KNOW" she mumbled. </p>
         <p>
            Since that day, I wanted to be in the aeronautic industry.
             But the family's financial status can't afford it. Dead dream!</p>
