  <!-- Intro -->
  <div class="intro">
    <p>It all started with a blinking airplane light in the middle of the night.
      I told my mom it is a moving star, and she replied, "it is an airplane".</p>
    <p>At that time, I had never seen a plane in person and had never been close to it.
      Can they see us? I asked my mom. "I DON'T KNOW," she mumbled.</p>
    <p>Since that day, I wanted to be in the aeronautic industry.
      But the family's financial status can't afford it. Dead dream!</p>
